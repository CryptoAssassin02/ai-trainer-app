## Proper Commands
    **Proper Test Commands:**
        `NODE_ENV=test npx jest --config jest.integration.config.js --runInBand`

## General Rules for Integration Test Implementation

    1. **Real Database Integration**: Always use real Supabase instance with actual database connections, never mock the database layer
    2. **Unique Test Data Generation**: Generate unique identifiers using timestamps and random strings to prevent test conflicts
    3. **Proper Server Lifecycle Management**: Use beforeAll/afterAll hooks to start and stop test servers with dedicated ports
    4. **Clean State Management**: Clear database tables, rate limiting state, and other stateful data before each test
    5. **Comprehensive Scenario Coverage**: Test both success and failure cases with descriptive scenario-based naming
    6. **Real Authentication Flow**: Use actual JWT tokens from the authentication system, not mocked or hardcoded tokens
    7. **Database State Validation**: Verify both API responses and actual database state changes using direct queries
    8. **Environment-Aware Testing**: Handle differences between test and production environments appropriately
    9. **Consistent Async Patterns**: Use async/await consistently throughout all test functions
    10. **Security-First Testing**: Include tests for unauthorized access attempts and Row Level Security (RLS) enforcement
    11. **camelCase vs. snake_case**: Always ensure we're using the correct case between camelCase and snake_case and in the appropriate scenarios.
    12. **Schema-Database Alignment**: Always verify API field names align with database schema before testing endpoints
    13. **Service Layer Field Mapping**: Ensure service layer correctly maps between API (camelCase) and database (snake_case) fields
    14. **Fresh User Data Per Test**: Generate unique identifiers for each test execution to prevent email conflicts and state issues
    15. **Progressive Debugging Approach**: When endpoints fail, debug systematically from basic access to complex scenarios
    16. **Task-Based Test Organization**: Structure integration tests according to implementation plan tasks for comprehensive feature coverage
    17. **Validation Schema Understanding**: Comprehend Joi validation behavior including schema-level vs field-level options and their interaction

    19. **Edge Case Validation Coverage**: Test boundary conditions, malformed data, and unexpected input formats systematically
    20. **Error Message Alignment**: Ensure test expectations match actual validation framework error message formats
    21. **Backend Behavior Discovery**: When tests fail, investigate whether backend behavior is actually superior to test expectations before assuming bugs exist
    22. **User-Friendly Error Message Testing**: Test for actual user-facing error messages rather than technical validation terminology or internal implementation details
    23. **Healthcare Data Standards Research**: Research official healthcare data standards (FHIR, HIPAA) and security standards (OWASP) before implementing medical data features
    24. **Backend-Test Alignment Verification**: Ensure backend implementation is updated and aligned before creating integration tests to prevent expectation mismatches
    25. **Multi-Layer Security Testing**: Implement comprehensive security validation tests covering all major injection types (XSS, SQL, NoSQL, code injection)
    26. **UUID Validation Implementation**: Add UUID format validation in controllers before database queries to prevent 500 errors and return proper 404 responses
    27. **Pattern-Following Approach**: Analyze and follow proven successful patterns from existing tests rather than inventing new approaches
    28. **Concurrent Request Testing**: Test high-traffic scenarios with Promise.all() for simultaneous requests to verify system behavior under load
    29. **Flexible Error Pattern Matching**: Use inclusive regex patterns for error message matching to accommodate variations in actual backend responses
    30. **Hybrid Controller Logic Path Testing**: When testing unified create/update controllers, use database state manipulation to force specific logic paths for comprehensive testing
    31. **Behavior Documentation Strategy**: When backend behavior deviates from REST standards, document current behavior in tests while noting ideal behavior for future improvements
    32. **Lifecycle Transition Testing**: Test complete operation sequences (create → update → update) to verify data consistency and logic path transitions
    33. **Idempotency Validation**: Test PUT request idempotency by making identical repeated requests and verifying consistent results
    34. **Service Layer Logic Verification**: Test that correct underlying service functions are invoked based on data state, even through unified controller endpoints

    39. **Performance Constraint Validation**: Test that complex operations (field mapping, conversions, concurrent requests) complete within acceptable time limits under various load conditions
    40. **Industry Disaster Prevention Research**: Research real-world failures (Mars Climate Orbiter, Gimli Glider) to understand catastrophic consequences and design tests to prevent similar unit conversion disasters
    41. **Mathematical Precision Factor Validation**: Test exact industry-standard conversion factors (0.45359237 for weight) to prevent accumulating precision errors in cascading conversions
    42. **Conversion Logic Path Discovery**: Investigate which operations perform unit conversions vs. which don't (PUT/POST vs GET behavior) to document actual backend behavior rather than making assumptions
    43. **Database Constraint Interaction Testing**: Use integration tests to discover how mathematical conversions interact with database constraints (e.g., weight = 0 constraint violations)
    44. **ACID Properties Integration Testing**: Systematically test database ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) through API layer using transaction rollback, concurrent access, and failure recovery scenarios
    45. **Authentication Response Structure Investigation**: Investigate actual authentication response field structure vs assumptions by systematically checking auth endpoints rather than assuming token field names
    46. **Cross-Session Data Persistence Validation**: Test data survival and consistency across different user login sessions to ensure data persistence beyond single session boundaries
    47. **Performance Threshold Environment Adjustment**: Adjust performance test expectations for test environment variability using flexible thresholds rather than rigid timing requirements
    48. **Comprehensive Resource Cleanup Strategy**: Implement thorough afterAll cleanup including server closure, timer clearing, singleton resets, and memory management to prevent Jest hanging and test interference
    49. **Error Message User Experience Prioritization**: Prioritize testing for user-friendly error messages over technical accuracy, recognizing that clear UX messaging is superior to validation framework terminology
    50. **Current vs Ideal Behavior Documentation**: When backend implements non-standard but superior behavior, document current implementation while noting industry best practices for future reference
    51. **Incremental Error Expectation Adjustment**: When multiple error message tests fail, fix expectations incrementally one at a time to verify each change reduces failure count before proceeding

## General Best Practices

    1. **Isolated Test Environments**: Use separate test ports and clean database state for each test suite
    2. **Precise Error Validation**: Test exact error codes, messages, and response structure formats

    13. **Field Mapping Verification**: Systematically verify camelCase ↔ snake_case mappings between API and database
    14. **Validation Message Specificity**: Test for specific validation error messages, not generic ones
    15. **Content-Type Enforcement Testing**: Verify endpoints enforce correct content types (JSON-only where required)
    16. **Systematic Validation Debugging**: When validation tests fail, debug validation schema options methodically rather than making multiple changes simultaneously
    17. **Schema Option Hierarchy Understanding**: Recognize that schema-level validation options can override field-level validation behavior
    18. **Boundary Testing Implementation**: Test minimum/maximum values, edge cases, and precision requirements for all numeric inputs
    19. **Alternative Format Testing**: When APIs support multiple input formats, test all valid formats and their conversion accuracy
    20. **Incremental Fix Verification**: Apply validation fixes incrementally and verify each fix reduces failure count before proceeding
    21. **Superior Backend Behavior Recognition**: When test failures reveal better-than-expected backend behavior, adjust tests to match superior implementation rather than forcing backend to match poor test expectations
    22. **Error Message UX Alignment**: Ensure test expectations align with user experience goals (clear, helpful messages) rather than technical implementation details
    23. **Incremental Expectation Adjustment**: When multiple tests fail due to expectation mismatches, fix assertions incrementally to verify each change works before proceeding
    24. **Healthcare Compliance Testing**: Include tests for medical data handling, audit trails, and healthcare-specific validation rules
    25. **Error Message Discovery**: When validation tests fail due to error message mismatches, investigate actual backend error messages rather than assuming standard validation library formats
    26. **Database Constraint Direct Testing**: Test PostgreSQL constraints directly alongside API endpoints to verify both application and database-level validation
    27. **Import Pattern Consistency**: Use consistent server import patterns (`{ app, startServer, closeServer }`) that match existing successful test implementations
    28. **Incremental Debugging Strategy**: When multiple tests fail, apply fixes incrementally and verify each fix reduces failure count before proceeding to next issue
    29. **Controller-Level Validation Enhancement**: Enhance backend controllers with proper input validation (UUID format, etc.) to prevent database errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes
    30. **Non-Standard Behavior Documentation**: When testing controllers with non-standard REST behavior, document current implementation while noting industry best practices for future reference
    31. **Round-trip Conversion Integrity Testing**: Test metric→imperial→metric accuracy through multiple unit preference changes to ensure data integrity and prevent cumulative precision loss
    32. **Syntax Structure Verification**: Always verify JavaScript syntax with `node -c` before running tests to catch structural errors early and prevent linter failures
    33. **Conversion Factor Precision Boundary Testing**: Test mathematical precision at conversion boundaries to prevent cascading errors in real-world scenarios
    34. **Comprehensive Jest Cleanup Implementation**: Implement proper Jest resource cleanup including timer clearing, singleton resets, server closure, and memory management to prevent hanging tests and resource leaks
