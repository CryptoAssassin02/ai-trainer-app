/**
 * Security Verification Checklist:
 * 
 * Authentication:
 * ✓ JWT tokens contain all required fields (sub, role, jti, exp, iat)
 * ✓ Token blacklisting prevents use of revoked tokens
 * ✓ Refresh token mechanism works correctly
 * ✓ Rate limiting prevents authentication brute force
 * 
 * API Security:
 * ✓ Content Security Policy headers are applied
 * ✓ HTTPS Strict Transport Security is enabled
 * ✓ X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking
 * ✓ X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME sniffing
 * ✓ CORS configuration limits access to authorized origins
 * ✓ SQL Injection protection blocks malicious inputs
 * ✓ CSRF protection for cookie-based authentication (when enabled)
 * 
 * Data Protection:
 * ✓ Input sanitization strips dangerous content
 * ✓ Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
 * ✓ Cookie security settings (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)
 * ✓ Cache control headers prevent sensitive data caching
 * 
 * Infrastructure:
 * ✓ Proper rate limiting across all critical endpoints
 * ✓ Graceful shutdown preserves session integrity
 * ✓ Request ID tracking for security forensics
 * ✓ Secure logging doesn't expose sensitive data
